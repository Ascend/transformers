# Token classification

## PyTorch version

Fine-tuning the library models for token classification task such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Parts-of-speech
tagging (POS) or phrase extraction (CHUNKS). The main scrip `run_ner.py` leverages the ðŸ¤— Datasets library and the Trainer API. You can easily
customize it to your needs if you need extra processing on your datasets.

It will either run on a datasets hosted on our [hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or with your own text files for
training and validation, you might just need to add some tweaks in the data preprocessing.

The following example fine-tunes BERT on CoNLL-2003:

```bash
python run_ner.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \
  --dataset_name conll2003 \
  --output_dir /tmp/test-ner \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --use_ascend \
  --use_combine_grad \
  --npu_fp16 \
  --npu_fp16_opt_level O2
```

To run on your own training and validation files, use the following command:

```bash
python run_ner.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \
  --train_file path_to_train_file \
  --validation_file path_to_validation_file \
  --output_dir /tmp/test-ner \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --use_ascend \
  --use_combine_grad \
  --npu_fp16 \
  --npu_fp16_opt_level O2
```

**Note:** This script only works with models that have a fast tokenizer (backed by the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library) as it
uses special features of those tokenizers. You can check if your favorite model has a fast tokenizer in
[this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#supported-frameworks), if it doesn't you can still use the old version
of the script.

> If your model classification head dimensions do not fit the number of labels in the dataset, you can specify `--ignore_mismatched_sizes` to adapt it.
